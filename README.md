# Early Dementia Diagnosis

Implementation: Early Dementia Diagnosis in Young Adults Using Machine Learning, Ensemble Methods, and Clinical Modeling


✅ Suggested Naming of Your Framework (Inspired by theirs)
You might call your system:
Early Clinical Dementia Classifier (ECDC)
Or
YODetect: A Machine Learning Framework for Early Dementia Detection in Young Adults

Let me know if you'd like help writing the method section like theirs, or structuring a comparative result table.

2. Correlation-Based Feature Selection
In the paper, they mention Spearman, Pearson, and partial correlation. You can apply these to:

Drop redundant features.

Understand relationships between input features and the target.
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy.stats import spearmanr, pearsonr

✅ 4. Outlier Removal
You can detect and remove outliers using IQR or z-score:

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy import stats
df = df[(np.abs(stats.zscore(df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]))) < 3).all(axis=1)]

✅ 5. Correlation Analysis
Drop highly correlated features:

python
Copy
Edit
corr_matrix = df.corr().abs()
upper = corr_matrix.where(np.triu(np.ones(corr_matrix.shape), k=1).astype(bool))
to_drop = [col for col in upper.columns if any(upper[col] > 0.95)]
df.drop(columns=to_drop, inplace=True)

✅ 8. Stratified Sampling
Ensure stratification when splitting the dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, ...)
