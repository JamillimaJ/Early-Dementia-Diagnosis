## About the Dataset

This dataset is sourced from the **Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)**, a publicly available collection of brain MRI scans intended to advance research in basic and clinical neuroscience. The initiative is supported by:

- Washington University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center  
- Dr. Randy Buckner at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), Harvard University  
- Neuroinformatics Research Group (NRG), Washington University School of Medicine  
- Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN)

## Dataset Description

### 1. Cross-Sectional MRI Data

- **Subjects**: 416 individuals, aged 18 to 96  
- **Scans**: Each subject includes 3 or 4 T1-weighted MRI scans from a single session  
- **Demographics**: All subjects are right-handed, with a mix of men and women  
- **Clinical Status**:  
  - 100 subjects over the age of 60 diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  
  - A reliability subset includes 20 non-demented subjects scanned again within 90 days  

### 2. Longitudinal MRI Data (Used in This Study)

- **Subjects**: 150 individuals, aged 60 to 96  
- **Total Imaging Sessions**: 373  
- **Scan Protocol**: Each session includes 3 or 4 T1-weighted MRI scans  
- **Demographics**: All right-handed; male and female subjects included  
- **Clinical Classification**:  
  - 72 subjects remained non-demented over time  
  - 64 subjects were demented from the initial visit onward  
    - Includes 51 cases of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease  
  - 14 subjects converted from non-demented to demented during the study period

## Inspiration

This dataset supports the investigation of early dementia prediction. Can we accurately classify or predict Alzheimer’s disease using MRI and clinical data?
