OASIS BRAIN IMAGING DATASET ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================

CROSS-SECTIONAL DATASET:
- Total Records: 436
- Total Features: 17
- Subjects with Dementia: 100 (22.9%)
- Age Range: 18-96 years
- Gender Distribution: {'F': 268, 'M': 168}

LONGITUDINAL DATASET:
- Total Records: 373
- Unique Subjects: 150
- Subjects with Multiple Visits: 150
- Average Visits per Subject: 2.49

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Most Important Features for Dementia Prediction:
     Feature  MI_Score
3    MMSE  0.286519
5    nWBV  0.238609
0     Age  0.213921
1    Educ  0.093276
2     SES  0.050622

2. Significant Differences Between CDR Groups:
   - MMSE scores show strong negative correlation with CDR
   - Brain volume (nWBV) decreases with dementia severity
   - Age is positively correlated with CDR

3. Missing Data:
   - Cross-sectional: Minimal missing data
   - Longitudinal: Some missing values in SES and CDR

4. Class Distribution:
   - Binary Classification (Has Dementia): {0: 0.7706422018348624, 1: 0.22935779816513763}
   - Multi-class (CDR Categories): Imbalanced with majority in Normal/Very Mild

PREPROCESSING COMPLETED:
[x] Missing value imputation
[x] Feature engineering (brain ratios, age groups, education levels)
[x] Outlier detection
[x] Feature importance analysis
[x] Statistical testing
[x] Dimensionality reduction analysis

READY FOR ML MODELING:
- Use 'oasis_cross_processed.csv' for cross-sectional analysis
- Use 'oasis_long_processed.csv' for longitudinal analysis
- Recommended target: 'Has_Dementia' for binary or 'CDR_Category' for multi-class
- Top features identified through mutual information analysis
- Consider ensemble methods for best performance
